# Vlog - A Blogging Application

![LightHouse Report]('./lighthouse-report.png')

I made this blog app as my interview task for [Ekbana](https://ekbana.com/).
so, I only done limited features that I was asked to do within **3 days**.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as Node.js web framework
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as NoSQL Database
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as ODM library
- [JWT](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) as a authentication library

### Frontend

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as a React framework
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) as a UI component library
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) as a markdown parser and renderer

## Things to consider

- Used own Backend.
- Used **JavaScript** instead of **TypeScript** as I think for small projects and working alone, TypeScript is **overkill**.
- Used Nextjs **SSR** for fetching **individual blog** and **blog list**.
- Used Material-UI for **fast** and **easier** UI development.
- No **State Management** library is used as I was running out of time.
- The whole app is **responsive**.

I made this blog app as my interview task for [Ekbana](https://ekbana.com/).
so, I've only done **limited features** that I was asked to do within **3 days**.
I hope you'll like this project and appreciate my effort.

Also, You can view the task list assigned to me as I have put it there for you.

## Technologies Used üíª

### Backend

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as Node.js web framework
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as NoSQL Database
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as ODM library
- [JWT](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) as a authentication library

### Frontend

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as a React framework
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) as a UI component library
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) as a markdown parser and renderer

## Things to consider ü§î

- Used own Backend.
- Used **JavaScript** instead of **TypeScript** as I think for small projects and working alone, TypeScript is **overkill**.
- Used Nextjs **SSR** for fetching **individual blog** and **blog list**.
- Used Material-UI for **fast** and **easier** UI development.
- No **State Management** library is used as I was running **out of time**.
- The whole app is **responsive**.

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Clone the repo

```js
git clone *https or ssh url*
```

### Add a .env file in server folder

```js
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8000
DATABASE=*your mongo database uri*
DATABASE_PASSWORD=*your mongo database password*
JWT_SECRET=*a secrect key*
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=90
```

### Install client dependencies

```js
cd client
yarn or yarn install
```

### Install server dependencies

```js
cd server
yarn or yarn install
```

### I recommend to use Nextjs build version just for testing

```js
cd client
yarn build
```

### Run both client & server from root

```js
yarn start (If you ran **yarn build**)
or
yarn dev (For local development)
```
